2. mysql: context deadline exceeded; sql: transaction has already been committed or rolled back  
the table under operation is possibly locked for other user for quite long time, causing this operation timeout.
```
# how will I know that some tables are locked?

You can use SHOW OPEN TABLES command to view locked tables.

# how do I unlock tables manually?

If you know the session ID that locked tables - 'SELECT CONNECTION_ID()', then you can run KILL command to terminate session and unlock tables.
```
